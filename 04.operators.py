#let us talk about operator
#definition - Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
'''
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators
'''
#arithmatic operator
'''Arithmetic operators are used with 
   numeric values to perform common
     mathematical operations:'''
x=9
y=4

print("Addition	x + y", x + y)	
print("Subtraction	x - y", x-y)	
print("Multiplication	x * y", x*y)	
print("Division	x / y" ,x/y)	
print("Modulus	x % y", x%y)	
print("Exponentiation	x ** y", x**y)	#4 times 9
print("Floor division	x // y",x//y) #it doesn't show after point value



#Assignment Operators
'''Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables'''
#value of x
x = 5
print(x)
#for increment off value
x += 3  #it is equal x=x+3
print(x)
x-=3 #it is equal x=x-3
print (x)
x*=3 #it is equalx=x*3
print(x)
x/=3 #it is equal x=x/3
print(x)
